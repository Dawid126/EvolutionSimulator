# EvolutionSimulator

Project created as a part of object-oriented programming I classes at AGH UST.

The project's aim is to simulate the life cycle of animals in the wild. With every iteration all animals move one tile in randomly choosen
direction (based on their genome). In order to move they have to use a portion of their energy, which they can gain eating grass. The grass 
is also generated with every iteration. If an animal's energy falls to zero, it dies. When two animals meet and have enough energy, they breed
and create a new animal with energy transfered from its parents.
